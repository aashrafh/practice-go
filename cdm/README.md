## About
It's a simple CLI tool that I use to download files. It depends on the built-in concurrent features of Go without any external dependencies.

## How to use
1. Setup [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) on your machine
2. Build: ```go build ./cdm main.go```
3. Run the CLI: ```./cdm --url "<file URL>" --path "<path to save the file>"```
