A Distributed Operating System is system software over a collection of independent, networked, communicating, and physically separate computational nodes. They handle jobs which are serviced by multiple CPUs.[1] Each individual node holds a specific software subset of the global aggregate operating system. Each subset is a composite of two distinct service provisioners.[2] The first is a ubiquitous minimal kernel, or microkernel, that directly controls that node's hardware. Second is a higher-level collection of system management components that coordinate the node's individual and collaborative activities. These components abstract microkernel functions and support user applications.[3]
The microkernel and the management components collection work together. They support the system's goal of integrating multiple resources and processing functionality into an efficient and stable system.[4] This seamless integration of individual nodes into a global system is referred to as transparency, or single system image; 
describing the illusion provided to users of the global system's appearance as a single computational entity.
